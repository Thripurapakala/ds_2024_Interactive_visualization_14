In this assignment, builded an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Displayed the sample's metadata, Created a bubble chart that displays each sample, Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, with all these plots created a dashboard.
